### Model > HasRelationships
This trait is more related to the relationship attributes and instances—setting,
getting, checking the existence of, etc. The other functionality revolves around
instantiating `Relation` objects and guessing key names/etc when not provided.

#### $relations
This is an array that holds all the loaded relationships for the model.

#### $touches
This is a list of all relationships that should be "touched" when the model is saved.

#### static function resolveRelationUsing($name, Closure $callback)
This lets you define relationships outside of the model itself, which are then resolved when
`Model::__call()` is used to load the relationship. Not really recommended unless you're dynamically
creating relationships for models inside a package.

#### hasX, morphX, belongsToX, etc
These methods are just helpers to instantiate a Relation object.

#### touchOwners()
This loops through all the `$touches` models and calls `$this->$relation()->touch()`. It
also runs recursively, so that each relation that's touched also calls `touchOwners()`
on all its configured `$touches`.


### Eloquent Builder

#### $eagerLoad
This is the array of relationships that need to be eager loaded. They're set using `with()`.

#### eagerLoadRelations()
Calls protected method `eagerLoadRelations` for each `$eagerLoad`

#### eagerLoadRelation()

  1. Get the relation via `getRelation()` (which loads it without constraints and
applies any nest `with()` statements as needed)

  2. Calls `addEagerConstraints()` on the relation

  3. Applies any custom constraints to the relationship query that were passed in as
arguments to the `with()` call (just calls the closure)

  4. Matches the results back to the parent models by calling `match()` on the relation


### Eloquent Builder > QueriesRelationship

#### has()
The `has()` method is used under the hood for `whereHas`/`orHas`/`doesntHave`/etc. It's
responsible for checking for the existence or count of a relation inside a model query.

The basic anatomy of a `has()` call:

  1. Get an instance of the relation by calling `getRelationWithoutConstraints()`—this specifically
loads the relationship without any default constraints applied.

  2. Call `getRelationExistenceQuery()` or `getRelationExistenceCountQuery()` depending on
whether the `$count` matters (if we're doing `>= 1` then `where exists` is the same
semantics but a faster query, and if we're doing `< 1` then the same is true for
`where not exists`).

  3. If a callback was added, apply the callback using `Builder::callScope` which is
responsible for merging in `where` statements/etc. The most important thing to note
here is that if our callback adds additional `where` statements to the query, the
`callScope` method will wrap them in a group so that `or where` statements don't impact
the rest of the query.

  4. Call `addHasWhere` to add our newly instantiated subquery to the builder:

  1. This first calls `Builder::mergeConstraintsFrom` to ensure that any custom
constraints that are defined in the model's `newBaseQueryBuilder` or
`newEloquentBuilder` methods are properly applied.

  2. Then it either calls `addWhereExistsQuery` or `addWhereCountQuery` using the same
heuristics from above, adding the either a `Where` or `Exists` statement to the
underlying query builder.

#### withAggregate()
The `withAggregate()` method is responsible for all the `withCount`/`withMax`/etc calls:

## Relation Interface
These are the relationship methods that seem to actually matter to outside callers:

  - `Relation::noConstraints` — tells relationships to load without the default constraints. This
    sets a static property that relationships have to check during `__construct()`
  - `getRelationExistenceQuery` — gets the version of the relationship for checking the existence
    of the related models. This is usually a `where exists ( ... )` subquery.
  - `getRelationExistenceCountQuery` — same as above but for when the count matters
  - `getRelated` — get the model for use in the relationship
  - `getRelationCountHash` — get an alias name that can be used when joining a table to itself
    or for other cases where a distinction needs to be made between multiple references to the
    same table. Generally results in `"laravel_reserved_X"` where `X` is incremented each time.
  - `getResults` — get the results of the query in a non-eager call
  - `getEager` — get the results of the query in an eager call
  - `addEagerConstraints` — tells the relation to apply eager constraints to the query
  - `match` — responsible for matching results back to parent models
  - `initRelation` — initialize the relation before query. In the case of a hasMany, for instance,
    this will set up an empty Eloquent Collection

## General Notes
In `HasRelationships::morphTo` the framework uses the lack of attributes to determine if a relation
should be instantiated in an eager/non-eager context.

It's necessary to handle self-relationships where a table may be joined in multiple
times, and therefore needs to do something like `getRelationExistenceQueryForSelfRelation`
